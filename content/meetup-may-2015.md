Summary: Highlights from the May, 2015 meetup.

Just like most months, we had the monthly meetup at KFC Kimathi on the first Saturday (2nd May). Eight people showed up.

### Topics Discussed

A lot was discussed. Opera Mini, and whether the Nairobi LUG blog should be accessible using this browser, Search Engine Optimization, learning Rust.. I'm not going to pretend I remember everything that was discussed, partly because I'm writing this one week later.

### GPL Violation

One topic that was discussed that I feel like I need to highlight is the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and how some Kenyan companies are violating it. [BRCK](https://www.brck.com/), for instance, runs a fork of [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) yet NONE of its code is open (at least the forked OpenWRT code should be). OpenWRT is a GNU Linux distribution that comprises of at least two high profile projects (the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org/) and [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/)) that are licensed under the GPL. All projects that are derivatives of OpenWRT therefore are technically licensed under the GPL. I reached out to the BRCK team but I still haven't gotten a response from them. It's time 'they' know we are not fine with them violating the GPL!

VIVA GPL!!
