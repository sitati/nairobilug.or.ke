Summary: Experimenting with hardware-accelerated AES on Sandy Bridge+ chipsets

Ever since the [Sandy Bridge microarchitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge), Intel CPUs have been coming with hardware-accelerated <abbr title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</abbr> support (aka "AES-NI", *new instructions*).  I figured it would be interesting see a comparison between AES with and without the hardware acceleration on my [Intel Core i5-3317U CPU](http://ark.intel.com/products/65707) (Ivy Bridge) on Arch Linux.

According to [a post](http://openssl.6102.n7.nabble.com/having-a-lot-of-troubles-trying-to-get-AES-NI-working-td44285.html) on the OpenSSL Users mailing list, you can force `openssl` to avoid hardware AES instructions using the `OPENSSL_ia32cap` environment variable.

## Benchmarks
First, with AES-NI enabled (the default, on hardware that supports it):

    :::console
    $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-cbc
    You have chosen to measure elapsed time instead of user CPU time.
    Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 16 size blocks: 57196857 aes-128-cbc's in 3.00s
    Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 64 size blocks: 15343650 aes-128-cbc's in 3.00s
    Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 256 size blocks: 3897351 aes-128-cbc's in 3.00s
    Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 1024 size blocks: 978726 aes-128-cbc's in 3.00s
    Doing aes-128-cbc for 3s on 8192 size blocks: 122310 aes-128-cbc's in 3.00s
    OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013

    The 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.

Then, setting the capability mask to turn off the hardware AES features:

    :::console
    $ OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000" openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-cbc
    You have chosen to measure elapsed time instead of user CPU time.

You can see that hardware-accelerated AES is pretty consistently **twice** as fast as the implementation without *aesni*.  So it's not an exponential win, but getting **twice** the performance is certainly very serious!  This is great for not only for servers using AES encryption (SSL/TLS, hello!), but also for consumers wanting to connect to said servers as well as things like full-disk encryption.

**Note:** It seems Arch Linux's OpenSSL is built with AES-NI support but not as an *engine*, so `openssl speed` could be misleading (ie, you'd see no difference with or without the capabilities masked).  To get the AES-NI support you need to use `-evp` ("envelope") mode, which is some sort of [high-level interface](http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP) for crypto functions in OpenSSL.
